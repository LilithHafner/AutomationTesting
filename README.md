This repo implements [Stefan's state machine](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/suggestion-to-slightly-improve-julia-development/50916/82) with some modifications with the intent to migrate to JuliaLang/julia once ready.

Execution steps
- [x] Try things out at https://github.com/LilithHafner/AutomationTesting (this repo) to make sure the concept is viable
- [ ] Incrementally deploy to https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia
  - [ ] First, incrementally depoloy tracking and reminders to reduce cognative load on maintainers and eliminate the cohort of pull requests that are dropped at some point in the process
  - [ ] Then incrementally add automation where possible to further decrease maintainer burden and increase efficiency
